                <p>Follow our <a href="#">guide</a>. If this does not work, please contact Epic Games Support. We cannot help you with account issues; we are not Epic Games.</p>

                <h3>Please remove my stats</h3>
                <p>Mark your stats private in the in-game settings, and we will no longer be able to access them. Your old stats will remain on the site, and we are working on a way to detect and remove them. We cannot manually remove them, so please do not contact us about it.</p>

            <h2>EVENTS F.A.Q.</h2>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can you remove my Power Ranking and Event statistics?</h3>
                <p>Our blanket answer to any type of account reset is "no". If we did it "just for you", then everyone would have to be given access to it.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>I have less PR now than before</h3>
                <p>This is likely due to time decay. After a certain timeframe, your previous events will be worth less and less Power Ranking as an incentive to perform in new events. Occasionally, we may retroactively change an event PR multiplier, but we'll always announce those changes.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>My Power Ranking amount doesn't match the number displayed on the graph</h3>
                <p>The Power Ranking number that appears on your events page is filtered by default to your main region and platform. The graph, however, is cumulative across all regions and platforms, resulting in a slightly higher PR on the graph than the filtered result.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>My Power Ranking is greyed out while my teammate received PR</h3>
                <p>If any of your teammates play with another team in the same event window and perform better, your team's Power Ranking is nullified. This is to prevent exploitation of the system by boosters.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>I was supposed to receive X Power Ranking for this Event but received less</h3>
                <p>It takes time for our servers to process your Power Ranking, especially after an event window closes. Allow a few hours before contacting us, as it typically resolves itself.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>I don't see an event I played in</h3>
                <p>You need to be within the top 10,000 of an event for us to track you. This limit helps us maintain server stability; thank you for understanding.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>I want you to add/remove/edit the Power Ranking for [insert event here]</h3>
                <p>We appreciate feedback regarding Event multipliers! Please ensure you submit it through the proper channel. Follow these instructions to correctly request a PR change.</p>
